# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## ðŸ”§ **Configure GitHub Pages to Show Your App (Not README)**

Your app is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, but GitHub Pages needs to be configured to serve from that branch instead of the main branch.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Go to your repository**: [https://github.com/Jordan-Ryan/magical-chore-tracker](https://github.com/Jordan-Ryan/magical-chore-tracker)

2. **Click on "Settings"** (tab near the top of the repository page)

3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar

4. **Under "Source" section**:
   - Change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Select **"gh-pages"** from the branch dropdown
   - Keep the folder as **"/ (root)"**
   - Click **"Save"**

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the changes to take effect

6. **Visit your app**: [https://jordan-ryan.github.io/magical-chore-tracker](https://jordan-ryan.github.io/magical-chore-tracker)

### **What This Does:**
- âœ… Serves your React app instead of the README
- âœ… Enables proper routing for single-page applications
- âœ… Shows the magical chore tracker interface
- âœ… Allows users to interact with the app directly

### **Alternative: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
The repository now includes a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when you push changes to the main branch. This is the modern, recommended approach.

### **Troubleshooting:**
- If you still see the README, wait a few more minutes
- Clear your browser cache and refresh
- Check that the `gh-pages` branch exists in your repository
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings

### **Your App URL:**
Once configured, your app will be available at:
**https://jordan-ryan.github.io/magical-chore-tracker**

ðŸŽ‰ **Enjoy your magical chore tracker!** ðŸ¦‰âœ¨
